        <p>Hi Everyone.

            My name is McLloyd Pise. My major is Applied Technology BS.
            I enjoy working with computers. I am married to
            Dadirai and we have three children.</p>

        <p>I am grateful for this wonderful privilege to join you in this course.
            I have always had a desire to study
            programming but never had the opportunity.
            I began my studies in 2016 but had to stop in 2018.
            I have resumed this year.
            All things are possible to those that believe in our Father and His
            Son Jesus Christ.</p>
