                    <p>I will be doing surveys and poles to find out what you my client needs and how best to improve my
                        offering to you. I plan to use the principles of UX design to refine and improve my approach.
                        You will also need to apply these principles on your website/app. The principals will include:1
                        Keeping our Focus on the User. The user comes first (always). This is one of the most common
                        fundamentals of UX design. It is important for UX designers to put themselves in the users’
                        shoes and design for their needs. Usability Testing. The usability principle is at the heart of
                        UX design since its main purpose is solving users’ problems. Accessibility Testing. It is vital
                        to ensure that all users, including people suffering from disabilities, can use your product
                        with ease. Context Matters Both for Designers and Users. Consider things like what device the
                        user prefers, what may lead the user to the product, and any other factor that can affect the
                        solution usage. Consistency is Key. Being consistent with design means implementing the right UI
                        components and repeating them to help users pick up the product much faster. Less is More. The
                        less is more approach focuses on simplicity as opposed to over-decoration of the interface.
                        Keeping Visual Hierarchy in Mind. Visual hierarchy is the designers’ way of transmitting the
                        importance of elements within a product to the user. A good visual hierarchy helps users’ eyes
                        move across the interface from the most crucial aspect to the least gradually. Understanding the
                        Power of Typography Providing the Right Amount of Control to The User Identifying the Mental
                        Models of Users Following the UX Design Patterns Information Architecture (IA) Storytelling UX
                        Design Understanding The Function of UX Deliverables Using Familiarity Principle in UX Design
                        Understanding User Testing in Theory and Practice Add Personality to Design Minding the
                        Difference Between Web-Based and Mobile Products Using the Right Tools for Efficiency Keep The
                        First Stages of Your Prototype Simple
