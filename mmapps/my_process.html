                <h1>Moble Application Development. My Process.</h1>
                <P>
                    On our website, you can start developing your own website/app by answering a series of questions
                    that will assist you in creating your own website/app. These questions will help you as you go
                    through the process we provide. Where do I start? I will guide you in the process of finding out
                    your ideas. How big will my website/app be? Which colors am I going to use on my website/app?
                    What functionality do I require? What are my target markets? What pictures do I need on my
                    website/app? Logo design? What software platform do I need? What information is required
                    beforehand? Who will use the website/app? 
                       
                </P> 
                <p>I will intervene as soon as a considerable amount of
                    work has been done and you have answered many of these questions. From this point on I will
                    introduce paid content. The paid content is very reasonable to accommodate you, the startup,
                    individual or small to medium business. In doing so I anticipate that you as my new client will
                    stay with me for the rest of the journey. As you grow, so will I grow with you. I believe that
                    if we must succeed, we must do so together. We must not leave anyone behind. As our societies
                    grow so must everyone else. By focusing on you, startups, individuals and small to medium
                    businesses, we will have a greater impact on society and the world at large.</p>
