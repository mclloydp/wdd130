You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Hi, my name is  McLloyd and I make mobile applications and websites for companies and individuals. My focus is small to medium companies including individuals and startups that find it difficult to access mainstream program development services. I am enthusiastic, open-minded, and flexible. I will work with you from program conception to deployment, giving great attention to detail at reasonable rates. You can view my portfolio which includes projects that I am currently working on online on my website at GitHub. 

        My focus is small to medium companies including individuals and startups that find it difficult to access mainstream program development services. I ran a small business and faced challenges in procuring services at affordable rates. These services included web development and software development. First, I did not have money to pay for such services since I was starting. Upfront payment options did not look well for me. I would like to offer such services for free to start with. The website will provide a starting point for small to medium businesses and individuals. I have an automated sign-up process that will guide you in developing your websites and/or software development. These basic steps are for free.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        On our website, you can start developing your own website/app by answering a series of questions that will assist you in creating your own website/app. These questions will help you as you go through the process we provide. 

Where do I start? I will guide you in the process of finding out your ideas.  

How big will my website/app be?  

Which colors am I going to use on my website/app?  

What functionality do I require? 

What are my target markets?  

What pictures do I need on my website/app? 

 Logo design?  

What software platform do I need? 

What information is required beforehand?  

Who will use the website/app? 

I will intervene as soon as a considerable amount of work has been done and you have answered many of these questions. From this point on I will introduce paid content. The paid content is very reasonable to accommodate you, the startup, individual or small to medium business. In doing so I anticipate that you as my new client will stay with me for the rest of the journey. As you grow, so will I grow with you. 

I believe that if we must succeed, we must do so together. We must not leave anyone behind. As our societies grow so must everyone else. By focusing on you, startups, individuals and small to medium businesses, we will have a greater impact on society and the world at large.

        I will be doing surveys and poles to find out what you my client needs and how best to improve my offering to you. I plan to use the principles of UX design to refine and improve my approach. You will also need to apply these principles on your website/app. The principals will include:1 

Keeping our Focus on the User. The user comes first (always). This is one of the most common fundamentals of UX design. It is important for UX designers to put themselves in the users’ shoes and design for their needs. 

Usability Testing. The usability principle is at the heart of UX design since its main purpose is solving users’ problems. 

Accessibility Testing. It is vital to ensure that all users, including people suffering from disabilities, can use your product with ease. 

Context Matters Both for Designers and Users. Consider things like what device the user prefers, what may lead the user to the product, and any other factor that can affect the solution usage. 

Consistency is Key. Being consistent with design means implementing the right UI components and repeating them to help users pick up the product much faster. 

Less is More. The less is more approach focuses on simplicity as opposed to over-decoration of the interface. 

Keeping Visual Hierarchy in Mind. Visual hierarchy is the designers’ way of transmitting the importance of elements within a product to the user. A good visual hierarchy helps users’ eyes move across the interface from the most crucial aspect to the least gradually. 

Understanding the Power of Typography 

Providing the Right Amount of Control to The User 

Identifying the Mental Models of Users 

Following the UX Design Patterns 

Information Architecture (IA) 

Storytelling UX Design 

Understanding The Function of UX Deliverables 

Using Familiarity Principle in UX Design 

Understanding User Testing in Theory and Practice 

Add Personality to Design 

Minding the Difference Between Web-Based and Mobile Products 

Using the Right Tools for Efficiency 

Keep The First Stages of Your Prototype Simple
